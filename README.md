Rasgulla, Rasagola or Roshogolla (Bengali: রসগোল্লা Roshogolla, Odia: ରସଗୋଲା Rasagola) is a South Asian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.

The dish originated in the Eastern part of Indian Sub-continent; the present-day Indian states of Odisha and West Bengal have variously claimed to be its birthplace. Bangladesh also unofficially claimed to be its birthplace but didn't applied for Geographical Indications tag for the same.

Some Bangladeshi confectioners and food historians believe Rasgulla originated in Bangladesh and later on got popularized by Nabin Chandra Das in Kolkata.[1] But few other Bangladeshi food historians don't back this claim.[2]

In 2015, a committee formed by the government of Odisha asserted that the sweet had originated in Odisha,[3] where it is offered at the Puri Jagannath Temple.[4] In 2016, the West Bengal government applied for a Geographical Indications (GI) tag for the variant called "Banglar Rosogolla" (Bengali Rasgulla) or normal Rasgulla, clarifying that the Bengal and Odisha variants were different in "both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing."[5]

In 2017, when West Bengal got its Rosogolla's Geographical indication status, the Registry office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar Rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they site the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing.[6][7]

In 2018, Odisha government applied for GI status for "Odisha Rasagola" (Odia Rasgulla was declared different from normal or Bengali Rasgulla), which got approved by GI Registry of India and subsequently Odisha got its own Rasagola's GI status on 29 July 2019.[8][9][10]
